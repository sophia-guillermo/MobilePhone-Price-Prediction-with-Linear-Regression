# Mobile phone price prediction with Linear Regression
A machine learning project to predict mobile phone prices using linear regression. This project demonstrates a full modeling pipeline from data preprocessing to performance evaluation.

## Project overview
This project involves predicting mobile phone prices based on various technical specifications. The end-to-end pipeline covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Files included
- `LinearRegressionModel.ipynb`: Complete implementation of the project
- `README.md`: This file

## Technologies used
- Pandas and NumPy for data handling
- Scikit-learn for modeling (Linear Regression)
- Seaborn/Matplotlib for data visualization
- Performance metrics (MAE, RMSE)

## How to run
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook or upload to Google Colab
2. Run cells in order to reproduce the results

## Key Takeaways
1. Explored relationships between phone features and prices
2. Applied feature engineering to improve model accuracy
3. Learned about the strengths and limitations of linear regression
